## Reverse Polish Notation Calculator Code Challenge

### Objective
Create a calculator that will take in equations in RPN format i.e. `5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -`.
This equation (normally written as `5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3`) should evaluate to 14.

### Process
I attempted to make my work process easy to follow by creating branches, writing clear
commit messages and updating comments about my process to the calculator.rb file.

### Run calculator
1. Clone down this project
2. From CL and in the project root, run `ruby runner.rb` to use calculator.

### Run tests
1. From CL and in the project root, run `ruby calculator_test.rb`.
